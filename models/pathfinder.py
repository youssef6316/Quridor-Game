models/pathfinder.py
====================
BFS-based pathfinder used to:
  1. Validate that a proposed wall placement does NOT completely block any
     player's path to their goal row (Quoridor hard rule).
  2. Measure the shortest path length for each player (used by the AI
     heuristic function).
  3. Enumerate all reachable squares from a given position (used for move
     highlighting in the UI).

All graph operations operate on the abstract board state (wall sets) and do
**not** import any Qt types, keeping the model layer free of UI dependencies.
